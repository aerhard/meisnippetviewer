# MEI Snippet Viewer

JavaScript viewer utility to display music fragments encoded in the MEI format on web pages with optional support for highlighting and mouse event handling. Builds on the MEItoVexFlow converter library and depends on jQuery 
 and VexFlow.  

## Setup

See the instructions at https://github.com/TEI-Music-SIG/MEItoVexFlow#build

Please note that it's necessary to build VexFlow (with rake) if you don't use meisnippetviewer.js or meisnippetviewer.min.js. 

## Demos

After installing npm and bower you can view the demos by running `grunt run` from the root directory and navigating to `localhost:8000/demo` in your browser (browser support: IE9+, Chrome, Firefox).
